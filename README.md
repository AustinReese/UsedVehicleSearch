# Used Vehicle Search

A web application built with Flask which scrapes used vehicle listings weekly from all regional Craigslist sites in the United States and allows users to filter them by criteria such as (but not limited to) city, price, manufacturer, and odometer.

This project has been taken offline but can be ran locally with an older version of the dataset converted to SQLite, find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)
